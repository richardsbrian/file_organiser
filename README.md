# File Renaming Tool

The File Renaming Tool is a user-friendly application that helps you quickly rename all the files in a selected folder. You can choose a custom base name, and the tool will rename the files sequentially. For example, if you select "training_data" as the base name, your files will be renamed to "training_data_1," "training_data_2," and so on. This is especially useful for organizing datasets, creating consistent naming conventions for projects, or simply keeping your files in order for easier access and management.
