# File Renaming Tool

The File Renaming Tool is a simple application built using the Python `tkinter` library. This tool allows you to efficiently rename files in a selected folder with sequential numbering.

## Features

- Rename multiple files at once with sequential numbers.
- User-friendly GUI for easy file renaming.
- Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental file renaming.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.


## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the program files.

3. Run the following command to start the File Renaming Tool:

   ```bash
   python file_renaming_tool.py

## How to Use

1. The File Renaming Tool GUI will appear.

2. Click the "Browse" button to select the folder containing the files you want to rename.

3. Enter a new base name in the "New Name" field.

4. Click the "Rename Files" button.

5. A warning message will appear to confirm the renaming operation. Click "Yes" to proceed or "No" to cancel.

6. The selected files will be renamed with sequential numbers, and the tool will display messages for each renaming operation.

7. Once the renaming is complete, a success message will indicate that the files were renamed successfully.

## Note

- Be cautious when using this tool, as file renaming cannot be undone, and it will overwrite any files with the same names in the folder.
